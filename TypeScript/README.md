# TypeScript

This directory explores TypeScript's fundamental concepts through practical tasks. Each task folder contains its own configuration files (`package.json`, `.eslintrc.js`, `tsconfig.json`, and `webpack.config.js`).

## Topics Covered

### Basic Types and Configuration
- Setting up TypeScript development environment
- Basic types: string, number, boolean, arrays, tuples
- Configuring TypeScript with `tsconfig.json`
- Using Webpack with TypeScript

### Interfaces, Classes, and Functions
- Creating and implementing interfaces
- Class declarations and inheritance
- Function types and type annotations 
- Optional and readonly properties
- Type compatibility and inference

### DOM Manipulation
- Working with DOM elements in TypeScript
- Type declarations for HTML elements
- Event handling with proper types

### Advanced Types
- Generic types and constraints
- Union and intersection types
- Type aliases and utility types
- Type guards and type assertions

### Namespaces and Modules
- Creating and using namespaces
- Namespace merging
- Module import/export syntax
- Declaration merging

### External Libraries and Ambient Types
- Working with ambient declarations
- Using declaration files (`.d.ts`)
- Importing external libraries with TypeScript
- Creating custom type definitions

### Nominal Typing
- Understanding structural vs nominal typing
- Implementing nominal type patterns
- Type branding and discrimination

Each task builds upon the previous ones to provide a comprehensive understanding of TypeScript's type system and features.
